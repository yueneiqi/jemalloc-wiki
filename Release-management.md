# Initialization
To initialize a release, create a milestone and a tracking issue, e.g. for [4.4.0](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/498), apply the [release](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/labels/release) label, and if the release is not purely based on the [dev](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/commits/dev) branch, create an ephemeral branch based on the [master](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/commits/master) branch, e.g. ```rc-4.4.0```.

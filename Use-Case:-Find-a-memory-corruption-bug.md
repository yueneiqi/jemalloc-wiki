If possible, really consider using the excellent [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) tool for memory debugging.  If for some reason valgrind won't work for you (e.g. it is too slow or uses too much memory), there are some basic features in jemalloc that may be of some help.

If jemalloc is configured with `--enable-debug` specified, various assertions are compiled in that can detect double frees, misaligned pointers, etc.  These checks are unnecessary for correctly functioning applications, but they can be helpful during development.

If jemalloc is configured with `--enable-fill` specified, you can set `MALLOC_CONF=junk:true` in the environment to tell `malloc()` to fill objects with `0xa5` bytes, and `free()` to fill freed memory with `0x5a` bytes.  It is quite common for an application to accidentally get zeroed memory from `malloc()`, which can hide bugs due to missing initialization code.  Another common mistake is to access an object after it has been freed.  If your application behaves differently with the `junk:true` option specified, there's a bug in the code somewhere.  Similarly, if the problem is intermittent, and `MALLOC_CONF=zero:true` makes the problem go away, your application probably depends on getting zeroed memory from `malloc()`.
